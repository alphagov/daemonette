Daemonette
==========

Daemonette runs a block of code as a daemon, with one additional feature: if
another block with the same name is already running, it will be killed before
running the new block.

Old processes are killed by sending SIGHUP. If after a reasonable period (20s),
the process has not gone away, SIGKILL is sent.

How to use it
-------------

    Daemonette.run("foo") do
      # Your endlessly-running job here
    end

After deployment:

    Daemonette.run("foo") do
      # Your endlessly-running job here
    end

(I.e. the same thing.) The first job will be killed before the second is run.
